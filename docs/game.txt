Game Brief
You are a chef on a ship, and you're running out of food. You need to kill and cook the crewmen of the ship to reach your destination.

- Killing crew in certain roles affects the running of the ship
  - Killing the captain hurts coordination between crewmen
  - Killing oarsmen hurts ship speed
  - Killing the helmsman means the ship can't turn
  - Killing the fella in the crow's nest means the ship can't orient for navigation
- Throw knives for range attack - limited ammo, if you throw a knife overboard you lose it
  - Knife splashing overboard distracts crew - can use this to your advantage
- Each level is a journey (e.g. England to Boston) - journey takes a certain length of time
  - You can make different trade-offs throughout the level - can't kill the navigator early but can once "land ahoy"
- Captain can come into the kitchen - have to hide the evidence
- Shop between levels - buy better/more gear, vegetables, etc
  - Feed captain favourite meal/ingredient to gain some kind of reward - buy the special ingredients from the Shop
- Fatten certain crewmen up for extra """meat"""
